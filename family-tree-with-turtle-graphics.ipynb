    "<p style=\"color: #c40045;\"><strong>Limitations:</strong> In its current state, the application is unfortunately only applicable to the ”traditional family”. However, there are many families with different structures and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Preferably, the user would be able to change the tree structure (e.g. add family members and generations) and enter the sex for each individual (i.e. female, male or intersex). In addition, I think that gender should be included and that it should be possible to further specify relationships (e.g. adopted, married or separated). Depending on the intention of creating the family tree, additional information might be useful (e.g. hereditary diseases).</p>"
